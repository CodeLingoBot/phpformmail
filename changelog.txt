! Change "comming" to "coming".
! Added automatic support for PHP3.  Script now detects the PHP version and calls the proper in_array().

! Changed the error logging when a bad recipient is found.  Each bad recipient should be logged if there is more than one in an execution.
+ Added error logging for "There is no recipient to send this to".
- Removed the compile url function.  Replaced the function with get_env('QUERY_STRING').
! Modified how stripslashes() was applied. Now it is only run once, on every variable.
+ Added a condition if realname is undefined to check to see if firstname or lastname exists and combines them to act as the "realname" for e-mail pourposes. :)
! Removed default filling of realname to "Unknown Stranger" and added support for empty realnames so just the e-mail will show up instead of realname and e-mail address in emails.
